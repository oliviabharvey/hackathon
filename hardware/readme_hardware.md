# Hardward Readme
This readme covers the hardware installation and connections.

## Overview
The hardware is composed of the following components:
 - __**LEDs**__: All LEDs are the generic 5mm, ≈15mA LED. They are all in serie with a 220Ω resistance to limit current to 15mA.
   - Tray light: LED near the food tray delivery system that turns on when food is available to give a visual indicator. Yellow-colored LED.
   - Experiment light: LED on the outside of the experiment box that turns on as a visual indicator that an experiment is currently ongoing. Red-colored LED.
   - Box light: LED on the top of the experiment box that act as a flood light. As of February 2022, this is currently unused in the code or experiment, but can be used when doing maintenance, etc. White-colored LED.
